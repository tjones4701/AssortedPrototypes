HelpTopics["HELP-MAIN"] = [[Stranded is a survival gamemode about gathering resources and building.

You have to manage your stats and gather resources to make it easier to survive.
First things first, F3 is your menu for everything.
Anything that F3 doesn't do either attack it or use it.

On Codename SKY there are a few things that you will need to know before playing.
First like most servers is to ask people. If you want you could just skip this
help thing and close this menu. Then you could just ask people how to play and
they will tell you. Or you could read this and get a basic understanding of 
the game.

I recommend you read each of the HELP sections, below is a list.
HELP-STATS
HELP-LEVELS
HELP-CREATE
HELP-WHATNOW
I recommend reading them in that order.

If you have an error see the FAQ
]]

HelpTopics["HELP-STATS"] = [[Stats are VERY important. If you don't monitor them your player will die.

HEALTH: This starts at half and your max health can increase by getting the adapted trophy.
To fill your health back to max you need to eat Cooked Food.

HUNGER: This decreases gradually and will hurt your health if it is at 0.
To fill your hunger you need to eat. Forage the ground (USE) and plant 
seeds that you find. Fruit such as melons, oranges and bananas will soon
grow and use them to eat. The higher your planting lvl the more fruit will
appear on one tree

THIRST: This decreases gradually and will hurt your health if it is at 0.
To fill your thirst you need to either go in water and press E or 
press E while not in the water to get a waterbottle and drink that
by using the menu (F3, other), but it is easier just going into
deep water and pressing E.

SLEEP: This decreases gradually and will hurt you if it is at 0.
Use the menu (F3, other). Then go sleep. It will automaticly wakeup
but if you want to wakeup earlier do the same and wakeup.
If you do not sleep under a prop you will lose health as well as your
weapons, you must sleep under a prop.If you sleep on a bed with a prop
over you, you will regain your sleep twice as fast.

That is all you need to know about stats.
]]


HelpTopics["HELP-LEVELS"] = [[LEVELS allow the player to perform actions quicker and more effectivly.

As you perform an action like Mining or Foraging you gain XP in a skill.
Once you level a skill you gain XP in your survival level. Every 4 skills
you level up you will gain 1 Survival level, every time you level in the 
survival skill you get more capacity to hold more resources.

I am not going to list the skills here because it is fun finding what skills
there are and also because if i list them horizontally they won't fit lol.

Remember the more you do it the better you get. Also if you level up some
skills you will even discover new resources.

That is all you need to know about levels.]]

HelpTopics["HELP-CREATE"] = [[BUILDINGS
By creating buildings you can build better equipment and gain more resources.
To create a building, Press F3, go to menus and then go structures.
Click on the buildings name to see information about it.
Once that menu is open, select a building to create.Green names mean you have
enough resources to construct it and blue means you have already built it 
before and don't need to build it again.
I recommend using Easy Precision when building, combined with 
smartsnap, this creates sound bases, if you have any problems ask an ingame player.

COMBINATIONS
To make a combination press F3 goto menus and then go combinations.
Combinations combine resources into other resources.

WEAPONS
Weapons allow you to perform actions more effective. To create a weapon do 
the same as a building but access the menu by pressing E on it.
Unlike buildings though you need the resources to create it. when you make it.

That is all you need to know about creating stuff.]]

HelpTopics["HELP-OBJECTIVE"] = [[Read this if you want to get the idea of this server

I would recommend reading the story as you sort of get where this is going. The idea 
is that you are survivors of a world apocalypse,and beneath you is a deadly Toxic gas
that will kill you within seconds. 

You are to build ships using the avaialable tools that are given and you build your
own ships that can travel to other islands or act as docks or a hovering base, it 
is entirely up to you and your imagination. Just a hint, hoverballs work really
well as well as thrusters, so by combining these together you can build a basic 
flying ship/base. 

Be aware that you will need to 
travel to an island every now and then until your abse becomes advanced enough
to self sustain. The higher your skills are the easier it will be for you to 
build your base.]]

HelpTopics["HELP-WHATNOW"] = [[Well what else? PLAY!

There is much more to learn but this is just the basics.
With the knowledge from this help you will be able to go into the big world
and survive.

Start off by mining stone and wood, then build a stone workbench. From there build
a stone pickaxe keep mining, once you get enough stone build s stone furnace. 
From here you can figure out what to do next if you have any troubles, 
like i said before ask another player, prefereably the highest leveled player there.

If you are wanting to find a simpler way instead of always going to the f3 menu go to,
F3 - Graphics - Toggle Q menu. After you have done this hold down Q and you will be
on the stranded Q menu which is what most people use as it has a lot more shortcuts.

Don't forget to read the rules and if you have forgotten how to close this
menu press F4 or click on the close Button.

Hope you enjoy our server and have fun.]]

HelpTopics["RULES"] = [[DO THESE AND GET PUNISHED
Mass killing(OOYB)  --Punishment: Kick
PropPushing         --Punishment: 1 day ban
Glitch exploiting   --Punishment: 7 day ban
General being a dick--Punishment: Varies
Hacking             --Punishment: Varies
Mass Prop Killing   --Punishment: 31 day ban
(OOYB: Stands for "Outside Of Your Base".)
You are NOT allowed to use your resource cache on other players resources, 
do not run around with your cache, keep it in your base.

Higher ranked players can also kick and ban, so quite simply don't do anything stupid.

REMEMBER: Just because it isn't on the list doesn't mean we can't ban you.
Admins can ban you for whatever reason they like and for however long they want, 
do not argue with them, they have the final call. Argueing with an admin will usually 
get you kicked or banned as it comes under "being a dick".

We have a 3 strike system. 
First time offence is the punishment.
Second offence is double the punishment.
Third offence is Perma Ban.
Stick to these rules enjoy what your doing and have fun,]]

HelpTopics["AWOL FEATURES"] = [[
RANKS
Currently we have an inbuilt achievements/ranks system that works and
tracks your progress on all AWOL servers. The higher the ranks the more
privileges you can get. 
The Ranks system relys on the total amount of time that you have been on an AWOL server. 
The more time you have the higher rank you get, the higher up ranks can give you special 
privivleges and those even higher give the best privivleges however they can only be 
achieved by admins aproval.
Respect those higher ranked then you and you will get respect back

ACHIEVEMENTS
AWOL CNS also has its own achievements, that can be achieved by 
passing certain goals or obtaining certain resources.
Aswel as AWOL CNS other AWOL servers have thier own achievements, so if you want to try 
something new check them out, the IP Address of each server is located in this menu under "AWOL".
To access the 'ACHIEVEMENTS' menu click the achievments button near close
or type "awol_menu" into console.

AWOL uses various models, the AWOL model pack can be found here.
http://www.mediafire.com/?xispj99sbh9xxdn
Most of the models are for Codenamesky, however there are some that work on AWOL Stranded as well.
TROPHIES
AWOL has trophies that enhance your speed, health, rate of which you mine, gather.
Trophies are there to help you and increase your skill. The more trophies you have 
the stronger you will become. Certain trophies require certain lvls so make sure
you read the description before you start building one.
]]

HelpTopics["AWOL LEARNED"] = [[
As well as having Ranks for all AWOL servers, Codename: Sky has an upperclass of player.
This upperclass is called "Learned", if a player is learned this means that they are 
trusted by AWOL and being Learned can have leanance to certain weapons knowing that 
they will not abuse them. Learned have more options as well as special weapons avaialble to them. 
However not being Learned does not put you at any disadvantage, 
but it is an achievement of its own, so its worth trying to get. 
Do not go nagging admins for Learned as they will not give it to you, 
they give it to ONLY those that they trust.

Learned can currently:
-Use Certain tools on vehicles.
-Use Christmas Weapons.

Soon to come:
-Custom Player Models
-Custom Weapons
-Custom Vehicles

There will be more features to come, if you would like to make some suggestions about 
Learned then contact a senior player, visit the AWOL forums(link can be found in the 
"AWOL" section, or contact -=AWOL=-MrElite.
