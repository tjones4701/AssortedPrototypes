<h1>Welcome to GSA Stranded!</h1>
<p>Modified by Antipodean and Korpse</p>

<p>Gmod Stranded is the gamemode where all players are put on one team, and encouraged to<br />
cooperate to survive. You have to survive by finding food, water and make shelter so you<br />
can sleep safely. This help menu is here to tell you how to survive, and how to play properly.<br /> 
This help menu can be reopened at any time by executing the console command <b><i>gms_help</i></b>.</p>

<h2>Needs</h2>

<p>You need food, water and sleep to survive. You can track all three stats, as well as your health,<br />
by looking at the HUD box in the top left corner.</p>

<span style = "color: rgb(170,0,0);"><p>Health</p></span>
<span style = "color: rgb(0,170,0);"><p>Food</p></span>
<span style = "color: rgb(0,0,1700);"><p>Water</p></span>
<span style = "color: rgb(170,0,140);"><p>Sleep</p></span>

<p>If you lack any stat below zero, you will lose health,
and eventually die. To get food, simply press use on anything edible. It will instantly increase<br />
your food gauge, and also a little health. To get water you can either press use on something drinkable,<br />
or simply stand in the water anywhere on the map. To sleep, you must use the console command<br />
<b><i>gms_sleep</i></b>, which will put you to sleep. You can then use <b><i>gms_wakeup</i></b> while sleeping to wake up.<br />
Watch out though, while sleeping you quickly get thirsty and hungry, so be careful not to starve in your sleep.<br />
In addition - you need to sleep in safe shelter, or else you'll lose a lot of health while sleeping.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>


<p>You will gain skills by performing their respected actions. For example, by chopping wood you gain lumbering skill.<br />
Skills are useful for reducing process times and unlocking features. For example, at survival level 3, you can sprint.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>Resources are gained through performing various actions. For example, you can get wood by chopping a tree.<br />
Resources can be used for various things such as spawning props.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>


<p>Tools are gained by making them at a workbench. Tools are useful for bettering your processes.<br />
For example, you can gain much more wood if you cut with a hatchet rather than your hands.<br />
Some actions can only be used with a tool, such as fishing with the fishing rod.</p>

<h2>How to get started</h2>


<p>To start out, you find some water. You can bottle the water for later by pressing use on the water.<br />
Secondly, you should secure some food. By foraging the ground (Press USE on the ground), you can gain seeds, which can<br />
be planted to grow into various plants. For example the melon seed grows a melon bush, with watermelons on it.<br />
Once you have food and water, you should get some wood or stone, and start building some shelter. When sleeping,<br />
you should be under shelter, if not you'll lose health. To gain wood, use your hands or a hatchet at a tree.<br />
To gain stone and/or iron, use your hands or a pickaxe at some rocks. Once all this is done, you can start choosing your own path!</p>


<p>This gamemode is based on the game Stranded II by unrealsoftware.<br /></p>
